The sun was setting behind the city skyline of Gamla Stan (literally “Old Town” in Swedish), and in its final hour, it threw ribbons of color across the sky. A plane had carried me to Stockholm, on the budget of Smith College, to give me the remarkable opportunity to spend six months studying the intersection of engineering and sustainability.

                                <br><br>Glancing to my right, I saw the cliffs, the ones that host a whole city on their backs, and inside of which the city of Stockholm has buried their water sanitation facilities. I saw beneath the concrete and the topsoil, into the vast network of pneumatic shoots that carry waste sorted out into three levels of recyclables and one for refuse. Their district heating pipes flowed too, ensuring efficient and sustainable heating of their homes.
                                
                                <br><br>In the distance stretched cranes outlined in gold by the falling sun, cranes which were leading a project to prepare the city for an influx of stormwater. Climate change modeling had projected that increased snowmelt from early springs and drastic winters would flood the area if measures were not taken, and the city had made it a financial priority to address it early on.
                                
                                <br><br>I was standing at the cusp of a city that truly valued and prioritized making a world with the power to sustain the oncoming storms. Many minds came together, each with their own small piece of the puzzle, and hands got to work. I want, more than pretty much anything, to spend my life being one of those minds, a pair of those hands.
                                
                                <br><br>This is why I chose to pursue my concentration in the environment, and why I keep taking classes in complex systems and sustainable design in parallel with my electrical engineering courses. In electronics, Kirchhoff's Voltage Law simply states that the voltages around a closed loop of wiring must total to zero. It is a fundamental, physical property of energy, which dictates that all the components in a circuit, no matter how big or how complicated, must stay in harmony with each other. I want to spend my life helping organizations and companies–their products, devices, and services– stay in a similar harmony, ensuring that our net demand is not greater than what the Earth gives. 
                                
                                <br><br>Moreover, I want to someday look out across my homeland of America and see the equivalent of those Swedish golden cranes on the horizon, and know that I played a part in getting them there; to know that the gifted plane ticket was paid back in full, in the sustainable future I helped to shape.

                                It was down to the wire; there was one week left of the summer, at the end of which we would bring our machine to Werfen’s office. Once there our boss, our boss’s boss, and our boss’s boss’s boss would judge our work during a presentation and demonstration, and this leading biomedical firm would start using our machine to make sensor cards for their blood analysis machine, the GEM5000.
                                
                                <br><br>We were six weeks in. In that time my partner and I had developed a fully automated, AI driven, real time image analysis system that would automatically fill these small sensor cards with a liquid polymer solution, stop the polymer precisely at a junction point in the card, and then UV cure the polymer so that it became hard. I had designed and built the electronics system, the 3D printed fixture that held all the parts in place, and co-programmed the AI scripts using OpenCV.
                                
                                <br><br>We pressed “run”, and watched the monitor as a live feed video capture of what the computer vision system could “see”, played on the screen. We heard the pump click, the polymer solution entered the card, a black and white outline of the liquid’s edge showed up on the screen, tracking it as it moved across the card to the junction point. Our heart rates sped up, like they always did, once the polymer solution approached the junction point. This moment was crucial; we had run dozens of trials prior to this, all of them with lackluster precision in terms of how flush the polymer had stopped at the end of the junction point. With baited breath we waited as the polymer reached the end of the junction point, the pump clicked off, and a purple light shined on the card. Thirty seconds later, the window on the monitor disappeared from view, and we could lift the lid of the light-tight enclosure that held the fixture and electronics I had spent that summer crafting. We lifted the card into the light and saw that the polymer edge was exactly lined up with the end of the junction point. I rushed to the microscope, the real test.
                                
                                <br><br>Beneath that lens lay a sensor card, which through technology of our own design had produced a result of incredible precision. Two weeks ago we would’ve been jumping with joy, but at this stage we were aiming for reproducibility. We ran fourteen more trials, eleven of which were as precise. A success rate of 73%; we had done it. 
                                
                                <br><br>The manual version of this system where an experienced human operator would, by eye, decide when to stop the pump at the right time, produced cards that were successful 25-50% of the time. On top of this, we had been using an old batch of the polymer solution, and were confident that with a fresh batch which provides the stability and consistency needed for higher precision, our success rate could be increased at least 5%.
                                
                                <br><br>At the demonstration of our machine we produced more successful sensor cards, this time with a different model of the card, and heard small expressions of shock from our otherwise straight faced employers. A highlight from my summer was hearing “Oh my god, wow” being muttered by my boss in reaction to picking up the sixth perfect card we had created that morning. 
                                
                                <br><br>This machine that we, two mere undergraduates, had developed from scratch, would be used to continue development of these special new sensor cards, and enable the company to reproducibly create standardized cards that could one day be used in their leading blood analysis machine. The blood analysis machine would then be used by professionals to diagnose and save lives.
                                
                                <br><br>I came out of that summer with a newfound confidence; I now know that when tasked with jobs of immense importance and technical complexity, that I can handle that responsibility and thrive.
                                More than that, these types of jobs, where I am directly responsible for making something seemingly impossible work, fills me with a great sense of purpose, and is precisely in line with what I want to spend my life doing.
