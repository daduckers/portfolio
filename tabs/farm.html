       Welcome to Smith College's 3D Printing Farm, affectionately referred to as "The Farm". <br><br>
       Located in Ford Hall's basement, we have three Ultimaker S3 printers. These are brand new, top dollar double extruder printers 
       run on Ultimaker's brand "Tough PLA" and a support material of "Breakaway White". If you have any questions don't hesitate to 
       reach out; the student manager is just a text away. We can help with <b>both design and printing!</b> <br><br>

        I'm an engineering major (class of 2024), who's been working with 3D printers since they came out!
        3D printing can seem daunting but it's really so much fun and quite addicting if you really get into it. 
        <br><br>
        Being able to see your design move between dimensions is the coolest thing: it's 0d in your brain, 2d on the screen of your 
        CAD software, and 3d once it's done printing! 
        <br><br>
        If you have any questions (no matter how small or how big they may be), I'm just a text away.
        I would seriously love to help in whatever way I can so don't be afraid to reach out!
        Happy you're here and happy printing :	&#41; <br><br>
