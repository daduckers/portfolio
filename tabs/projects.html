                    In 12th grade I spent the year prototyping mechanical automata inspired by 
                    18th century Dutch clocks.
                    <br> <br>
                    This project taught me
                    heaps about moving designs from the internal to external, mental to physical world. I learned to design based on 
                    real physical properties like gravity, friction, material tolerances, and order of fabrication.
                    Many of the parts I designed in Fusion 360 made it easy to assemble
                    prototypes from my 3D printer. Others I made by brazing and shaping brass tubing.

                    <p class="seniortext" id="small"> In 8th grade I made a 3D printed robotic hand that’s controlled by a flex-sensor equipped
                    glove. Or at least that was the plan. Flex sensors were pretty expensive so I tried to make my own flex sensors with 
                    conductive black plastic, but sadly they were never sensitive enough to work. Instead I opted for potentiometers last 
                    minute after weeks and weeks of attempts to get the sensors to work. <br>
                    <br>
                    The end result wasn’t what I had originally planned for but overall I was 
                    happy with the build. This project tested my patience and it was here that I learned to stick through the fustration that comes 
                    with making.</p>
