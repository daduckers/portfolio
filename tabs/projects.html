            <p class="seniortext"> In 12th grade I spent the year designing and building mechanical automata inspired by 
                18th century Dutch clocks. <br><br>Many of the parts I designed in Fusion 360 made it easy to assemble
                prototypes from my 3D printer. Others I made by brazing and shaping brass tubing. This project taught me
                heaps about moving designs from the internal to external, physical world. I learned to design based on 
                real physical properties like gravity, friction, material tolerances, and order of fabrication.

            <p class="gradeprojecttext"> In 8th grade I made a 3D printed robotic hand that’s controlled by a flex-sensor equipped
             glove. Or at least that was the plan. Flex sensors were pretty expensive so I tried to make my own flex sensors with 
            conductive black plastic, but sadly they were never sensitive enough to work. Instead I opted for potentiometers last 
            minute after weeks and weeks of attempts to get the sensors to work. <br>
            <br>
            The end result wasn’t what I had originally planned for but overall I was 
            happy with the build. This projected tested my patience and it was here that I learned to stick through the fustration that comes 
            with making.</p>

                I made this site from scratch using css and html. You can download it from my

                if you like and make it your own. I'm writing it over spring break of sophomore year. It's pretty
                 fun :)
