            <p class="abouttext"> Hey I'm Janna! (sounds like Yah-nah) <br><br>
                
                I love making things and dream of being an engineer working on devices that
                realize a sustainable future. I love the intersection of the mechanical and natural and there's a special place
                    in my heart for biomimicry. I want to work with people who share my passion for considering the life-cycle and 
                ecological impact of our systems and devices. <br><br>

                I'm really into curiosity and am enthusiastic about learning and making cool stuff (check out my projects tab!).
                    Outside of working on projects I read philosophy and spend time in nature ðŸŒ¿<br><br>

                I grew up attending public school in New England, went on to a Waldorf school, and am now at Smith College studying engineering.
                    As I progress through my classes I'm designing and building a biomimicry-inspired Tiny House. Check it out below!
