                I love making things and dream of being an engineer working on devices that
                realize a sustainable future. I love the intersection of the mechanical and natural and there's a special place
                    in my heart for biomimicry. I want to work with people who share my passion for considering the life-cycle and 
                ecological impact of our systems and devices. <br><br>

                I'm really into curiosity and am enthusiastic about learning and making cool stuff (check out my projects tab!).
                    Outside of working on projects I read philosophy and spend time in nature ðŸŒ¿<br><br>

                I grew up attending public school in New England, went on to a Waldorf school, and am now at Smith College studying engineering.
                    As I progress through my classes I'm designing and building a biomimicry-inspired Tiny House. Check it out below!

                <p class="bigtext">My longest running project:</p>
                <p>For the past four years I've been designing and building a <strong>Tiny House.</strong><br><br>

                    Philosophy: to live sustainably and intentionally, to cultivate a space that both aids and inspires the way I want to live my life:
                     intentionally, creatively, curiously, and in appreciation of the natural world.<br><br>
                    
                     <strong>Design Features:</strong> <br>
                     Loft: I want to wake up to sunrises, rest with sunsets, and fall asleep stargazing. The dome shape maximizes 
                     passive solar while also making the loft feel cozy and natural compared to the harsh right
                            angles of standard construction. Made of reclaimed PVC event-tent material that I'll collect
                            from local buisnesses. Automatic shades close in the evenings reserving Rth while allowing maximum
                            Qin from the sun in the day.<br><br>
                    
                    Floor: In most of my mock-ups I've included raised portions of the floor (about a foot in height). These
                    sections serve as much needed storage but also convientiently break up the floor layout to create and divide 
                    micro-spaces like the kitchen, main living/working area, and bathroom. <br><br>

                    Kitchen: I've opted for an end kitchen; I wanted to keep as much width to the tiny house as possible.
                    In addition, I've placed large windows within eye-level of the washing-up area both to make the space feel larger
                    by extending sight lines from the other side of the house, and to promote an emotionally warmer cooking space where an herb garden
                    and bird feeder are visible from.<br><br>

                    Water: I plan to collect rainwater and only produce grey water (I'll be using a composting toilet) which will be 
                    rerouted to a filter garden before re-entering the Earth's water system.<br><br>

                    Energy: Solar panels will take care of my electrical needs. Because the house will be passive solar I won't need
                    much power. Throughout the winter I will occasionally use a small wood-stove.
